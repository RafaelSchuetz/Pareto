 abstract = {The well-known positive association between health and income in adulthood has antecedents in childhood. Not only is children's health positively related to household income, but the relationship between household income and children's health becomes more pronounced as children age. Part of the relationship can be explained by the arrival and impact of chronic conditions. Children from lower income households with chronic conditions have worse health than do those from higher-income households. The adverse health effects of lower income accumulate over children's lives. Part of the intergenerational transmission of socioeconomic status may work through the impact of parents' income on children's health.},

 abstract = {This paper estimates the rate of return to the High/Scope Perry Preschool Program, an early intervention program targeted toward disadvantaged African-American youth. Estimates of the rate of return to the Perry program are widely cited to support the claim of substantial economic benefits from preschool education programs. Previous studies of the rate of return to this program ignore the compromises that occurred in the randomization protocol. They do not report standard errors. The rates of return estimated in this paper account for these factors. We conduct an extensive analysis of sensitivity to alternative plausible assumptions. Estimated annual social rates of return generally fall between 7-10 percent, with most estimates substantially lower than those previously reported in the literature. However, returns are generally statistically significantly different from zero for both males and females and are above the historical return on equity. Estimated benefit-to-cost ratios support this conclusion.},

 abstract = {MOTIVATION

Large amounts of information generated by genomic technologies are accompanied by statistical and computational challenges due to redundancy, badly behaved data and noise. Dimensionality reduction (DR) methods have been developed to mitigate these challenges. However, many approaches are not scalable to large dimensions or result in excessive information loss.

RESULTS

The proposed approach partitions data into subsets of related features and summarizes each into one and only one new feature, thus defining a surjective mapping. A constraint on information loss determines the size of the reduced dataset. Simulation studies demonstrate that when multiple related features are associated with a response, this approach can substantially increase the number of true associations detected as compared to principal components analysis, non-negative matrix factorization or no DR. This increase in true discoveries is explained both by a reduced multiple-testing challenge and a reduction in extraneous noise. In an application to real data collected from metastatic colorectal cancer tumors, more associations between gene expression features and progression free survival and response to treatment were detected in the reduced than in the full untransformed dataset.
