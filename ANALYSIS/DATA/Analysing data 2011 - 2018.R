### 1. Time series: Average subsidy MT for an instiution

## a) Mean of a variable for every year

# Create a new data set only including the two variables "subsidyReceivedNo" and "year"
df <- data.frame(data201118$subsidy, data201118$year)
View(df)

library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# 1. Possibility: aggregate ()
# Aggregate column 1 of data set df, grouping by df$data201118.year and applying the mean-function
# na.rm = TRUE indicates that NA values are stripped before taking the mean

aggregate(df[,1], list(df$data201118.year), mean, na.rm = TRUE)


# 2. Possibility
# Defining variables "Year" and "Subsidy" as vectors by command c()
Year <- c(df$data201118.year)
Subsidy <- c(df$data201118.subsidy)

# Creating a new data frame with the variables "Year" and "Subsidy"
df <- data.frame(Year, Subsidy)


# The operator %>% pass the left hand side of the operator the first argument of the right hand 
# side. Grouping the data set df by the Year with group_by(). The command summarise() create
# a variable "averageSubsidy" which is the mean of "Subsidy".
mean_by_year <- df %>%
  group_by(df$Year) %>% 
  summarise(averagedSubsidy = mean(Subsidy, na.rm = TRUE))

# 2011 and ending in year 2018, using a frequency of 1 because the data are collected anually
